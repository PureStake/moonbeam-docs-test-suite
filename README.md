# Moonbeam Docs Test Suite

This repository contains tests for the tutorials found on the [Moonbeam docs](https://docs.moonbeam.network/) site (the [moonbeam-docs repository](https://github.com/purestake/moonbeam-docs)). The tests are written in JavaScript using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).
